      //Solution is 15 lines of code.  The instructions make it look like a longer assingment than it really it is.

      //Event handler setup
      //1. Create an event handler on the window object for the load event
      window.addEventListener("onload", function(event){})

      var mx
      var my

      //2. Create an event handler on the window object for the mousemove event
        window.addEventListener("mousemove", function(event){

        //3. Inside of the callback function of this event handler, create offset distances for X and Y from the mouse
          //var mx = event.pageX
          //var my = event.pageY
          mx = 5;
          my = 5;
    
        //Move the spaceship towards the mouse 
        //4. Get the image element & store it in a variable
        var spaceship = document.getElementById("spaceship1") 
        //5. move the image by setting the coordinates of left & top refer to slide .  Ex. node.style.left = your coordinates calculation here.
        spaceship.style.left = event.pageX + "px"
        spaceship.style.top = event.pageY + "px"  
        //Note node is the variable name you stored your image element in.
        //Note the left & top properties track the x & y coordinates respectively & must be set seperately.
        
        
    
    //Coordinates calculation for left & top properties
    //6. Use the JS built-in function parseInt() to cast your calculation from a float to an int. Refer to https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseint.asp
    //7. Get the current x & y coordinates & add the offset from step 3.
    //8. Use the JS built-in function Math.random() to add a random number to increment the movement of the image following the mouse. 
    // Ex. + (Math.random()*200 + 100))
    //Refer to https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp 
    //9. Concatenate the pixel unit to your calculation. Ex. + 'px';
      })
  
  //Move the alien away from the cursor when the cursor is moved close to the alien image.
  //10. Get the image element & store it in a variable 
  var alien = document.getElementById("alien")

  //11. Get browser's current width & height to set a horizontal limit for the alien image & store in variables.
  var w = window.innerWidth
  var h = window.innerHeight

    //12. Attach an event handler to the alien image for the mouseover event
    alien.addEventListener("mouseover", function(event){

    //13. Use the target property of the event object to change the coordinates. Ex. event.target.style.left = your coordinates calculation (again refer to steps 8 & 9)
    /*
    do{
      var x = event.pageX + (Math.random()*600 - 300)
      var y = event.pageY + (Math.random()*600 - 300)
    } while (x < 0 || x > w || y < 0 || y > h)

    event.target.style.left = x + "px"
    event.target.style.top = y + "px"
    */ //while more sensible, I chose to opt out of this more thorough method for moving the alien to better match the outline of the project
    event.target.style.left = (Math.random()*w) + "px"
    event.target.style.top = (Math.random()*h) + "px"
    //14. Your coordinates calculation requires the variables created in step 11.
